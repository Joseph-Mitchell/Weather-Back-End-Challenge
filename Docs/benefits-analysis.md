# Benefits Analysis

## Problem

Currently there is no user oriented content for the website; all of its users see the same thing. This is an issue because many users have expressed a desire for a more personalised experience.
<br/><br/>
This problem can be solved by introducing a 'favourite locations' system, which would let a user mark a location as a 'favourite', allowing them to easily access forecasts for these locations.

## Benefits

### Benefits to the user
 - Being able to save favourite locations allows easier use of the website, providing users with desired information quicker.
 - Having favourite locations connected to an account means users can use the website on multiple devices and still gain access to their list of favourites.

### Benefits to the company
 - The feature of a favourite locations list provides functionality to the user which may not be available to competitors, thereby increasing the chance of users switching to the companies service.
